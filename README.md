# kickstarter-angular
Package created to generate the necessary folders to better organize an Angular project for equal or later versions to 2.

# Why?
We know that angular is component oriented but over time and with project growth, if there is no basic design organization, it will get confusing and difficult to maintain. So in order to improve maintenance and start a project in a structured way, I created this package.

# Credits
I ask you to contribute to our improvement. It was my first npm package.
